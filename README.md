# ML-ClimateWins2
Unsupervised ML model - RandomForest, CNN, GAN

## 1. Project Background
ClimateWins is a non-profit organization dedicated to understanding and mitigating the impacts of climate change, particularly focusing on the weather patterns across Europe. In recent decades, Europe has experienced a marked increase in extreme weather events, including intense storms, prolonged droughts, and devastating floods. These events have significant implications not only on the environment but also on socio-economic stability across the continent.

## 2. Objectives
- Finding new patterns in weather changes over the last 60 years.
- Identifying weather patterns outside the regional norm in Europe.
- Determining whether unusual weather patterns are increasing.
- Generating possibilities for future weather conditions over the next 25 to 50 years based on current trends.
- Determining the safest places for people to live in Europe within the next 25 to 50 years.

## 3. Tools
- Python: The primary programming language for data analysis and machine learning tasks.
- TensorFlow & Keras: Advanced libraries for building neural network models to analyze complex patterns within the data.
- Scikit-Learn: Used for implementing classical machine learning algorithms for comparative analysis and model selection.

## 4. Models
- Hierarchical clustering by Dendrogram
- PCA for dimensionality reduction
- RandomForest to identify more important variables
- CNN & GAN model to predict future weather conditions based on image recognition
- Hyperparameters optimizations - Grid/Random Search, Bayesian optimization
